Visual workflow to orchestrate your cicd
source: codecommit,git hub ...
build : code build, Jenkins, cloudbess, teamcity
test: codebuild, AWS device farm, 3rd party tools
Deploy : codedeloy,elastic beanstalk, cloudformation, ecs, s3 ...
invoke : lambda, step functions
consists of stages -> each stage can have sequential actions and or parallel actions -> build -> test -> deploy -> load testing -> 
manual approval can be defined at any stage

CodePipeline - Artifacts :

Each stage can create artifacts
Artifacts stored in s3 bucket and passed on to the next stage

Dev -> codecommit(source) -> s3 -> codebuild (build) -> s3 -> code deploy(deploy) -> deploy

Codepipeline -troubleshooting
cloudwatch events, failed, cancelled, info on the console, check IAM permissions, cloudtrail used to audit AWS API calls
