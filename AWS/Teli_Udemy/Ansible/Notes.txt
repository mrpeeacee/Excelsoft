Ansible – Configuration Management (Day X in your roadmap)
1. Core Concepts
Idempotency: Tasks run by Ansible produce the same result no matter how many times they're run.

Agentless: Ansible uses SSH to communicate with nodes—no agent installation needed.

Playbooks: YAML files where you define tasks.

Inventory: List of servers Ansible will manage.

Modules: Pre-written code for tasks like installing packages, copying files, restarting services, etc.

2. Setup
Install Ansible on a control node (typically your local machine or a VM).

Create an inventory file: hosts

ini

[webservers]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11
Test connection:

bash

ansible all -i hosts -m ping

3. Sample Playbook: Install Apache
yaml

---
- name: Install Apache Web Server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
Run with:

bash

ansible-playbook -i hosts apache.yml

4. What It Helps With
Keeps systems consistent across environments.

Handles repetitive tasks (like creating users, setting permissions, etc.).

Automates patching, configuration updates, and service restarts.
